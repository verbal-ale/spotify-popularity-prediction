# Week 7

## Wed 25/10
*Present: Alex Alexandra Diego Sai Sankalp* 

In week 6 of our Machine Learning project, our focus was on collecting popularity data for individual chunks. 

Today (week 7, first lab), we have successfully integrated all these individual pieces to create our main dataset. Additionally, we have now delved into data exploration, focusing on normalization and creating visualizations. These steps are essential in our journey to efficiently utilize the data for clustering and training the CNN model. This week, we will focus on wrapping up the first phase of our project, i.e. finalising the reporting in the main READ ME.md file.

Furthermore, we have allocated tasks to work on for reporting in the main README.md file.:
Spotify API and Spectrograms: Alexandra
Stitching and Organising the Dataset: Alex
Feature Selection: Diego
Normalisation and Visualisation: Sai and Sankalp

## Task for next week: ##
 
TO DO:
- Begin drafting a notebook for visualisation to plug our data once it's all set up.
- Complete EDA and start Feature engineering.
- Research Clusters and Decision trees so we can start implementing straight away once the data is done
