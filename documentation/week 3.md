# Week 3

## Wed 27/09
*Present: Alex Alexandra Diego Sai*

Picked a final [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcfurland/10-m-beatport-tracks-spotify-audio-features?select=sp_track.csv) to use and after consulting a lab helper the team decided to implement spectogram analysis to cover the R5 (tCNN) requirement. 

## Thu 28/09
*No meeting today*

as Sai and Alex were busy with another lab scheduled at the same time and Alexandra was feeling unwell.

*Present: Alex Alexandra Diego Sai*

Diego and Alexandra teamed up to find a way to generate the spectograms and add them to the dataset. An issue arose with upload space limitations on github as well as the production of the spectograms themselves as the DB we chose contains links to sample audio for every track which would mean we'll have to download a substantial amount of audio data. Alex proposed limiting the number of audio samples to a smaller subset.

Alex kept notes and updated the project documentation.

Project milestones/deadlines were discussed and agreed upon.

## Task for next week: ##
Select relevant csv files, begin with data pre-processing and EDA.
