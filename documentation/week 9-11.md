*Present: Alex Alexandra Diego Sankalp* 

We focused on finishing the first phase on the project and divided the work needed to be carried out for the second phase as follows: 

Alex and Sankalp: Clustering

Diego: Decsision Trees

For the remaining 2 weeks we each worked on our respective pieces, using labs to bounce off ideas and report on progress.
